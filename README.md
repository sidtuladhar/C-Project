# C-Project
A example of showcasing how blockchains work.


### Blake2s256
Blake2s256 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a digest of 256 bits. It is a faster and more secure alternative to SHA-256. It is used in this project to hash the block data.

## To Do List

- [x] Create blockchain structure
- [ ] Create a way to add blocks to the chain
- [x] Add a way to mine blocks (Proof of Work)
- [ ] Create a way to verify the chain
- [ ] Add a way to display the chain
